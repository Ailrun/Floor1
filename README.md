# Floor1

**Floor1** is a *super* basic proof assistant, implemented using PHOAS-like approach as an experiment.

**Floor1** does not support any elegant features by currently, nor is there a plan to add such. The only possibly reasonable application of **Floor1** is pedagogical practice, but even that won't provide high-quality experience until all main functionalities are done. For more information, check the following TODO list.
